  title: Activesupport::DeprecationTestHelper
  description: A test helper that removes `ActiveSupport::Deprecation` noise from
    being interlaced in your test output. Instead this gem collects any and all deprecation
    warnings that occur during your tests, and succinctly reports them at the end
    of the test run.
